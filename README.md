This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This plugin is very young and written quickly, but can be used effectively with daily notes to keep a record of the work done and which files you continue to come back to.

Please open an issue for any bugs, feature requests, or feedback at https://github.com/trydalch/obsidian-daily-activity/issues/new
